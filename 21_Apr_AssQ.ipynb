    "\n",
    ">Manhattan distance, also known as L1 distance, is the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the two data points. It is called Manhattan distance because it is equivalent to the distance a car would travel to get from one point to another in a city grid-like road system, where only horizontal and vertical movements are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The difference between Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor, depending on the nature of the data and the problem being solved. Euclidean distance is more sensitive to differences between values in different dimensions, which means that it is more effective for data that has strong correlations between its features. On the other hand, Manhattan distance is more effective for data that has fewer correlations between its features. \n",

The choice of k determines the number of neighbors that are considered when making a prediction, and can have a significant impact on the accuracy and performance of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    ">There are several techniques that can be used to determine the optimal value of k:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Grid search: This involves evaluating the performance of the model over a range of k values using a validation set. The optimal k value is the one that produces the highest accuracy or the lowest error rate on the validation set.\n",

    "3. Domain expertise: In some cases, the optimal k value can be determined by the nature of the problem being solved or by prior knowledge of the data. For example, if the problem involves predicting the price of a house based on its location, it may be reasonable to assume that the optimal k value is relatively small since the price of a house is likely to be influenced by a small number of nearby houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Elbow method: This involves plotting the accuracy/error rate as a function of k and identifying the \"elbow\" point where the accuracy/error rate starts to plateau. This point is often a good indication of the optimal k value.\n",

Therefore, it is often a good practice to experiment with different values of k and evaluate their performance on a validation set or through cross-validation to determine the optimal k value."

    "\n",
    "1. Euclidean distance: Euclidean distance is sensitive to the magnitude of differences in each feature dimension. It works well when the data has meaningful differences between different dimensions or when the differences between different features are important. For example, Euclidean distance may work well when comparing the heights and weights of different people, where both dimensions are meaningful and can have a significant impact on the outcome.\n",

It has a parameter \"p\" that determines the degree of sensitivity to the magnitude of differences between different dimensions. For p=1, it is equivalent to Manhattan distance, and for p=2, it is equivalent to Euclidean distance.\n",

This involves training and evaluating the model on different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the set of hyperparameters that gives the best performance on a validation set. Cross-validation can also be used to estimate the generalization performance of the model and prevent overfitting.\n",

This process is repeated for different training set sizes, and the performance of the model is plotted as a function of the training set size.\n",

This can help to increase the diversity of the training set and improve the generalization performance of the model."
